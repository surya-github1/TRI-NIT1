                <p>What kind of soil do you use?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>Fruits and vegetables get their nutrients from the soil – and that means a fruit or veggie is only as
                    nourishing as the soil in which it was grown.

                    Great, fertile soil is its own ecosystem, with microorganisms and organisms that work together to
                    break down and create nutrient-rich matter. Soil also works within the larger ecosystem of the farm,
                    including the animals that fertilize or graze, the birds in the area, the water used, the sunshine,
                    and more. A good farmer will understand this symbiotic environment and work to create soil that is
                    nourishing.</p>

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="accordion__question">
                <p>What kind of pest control measures do you use? Do you spray all year or at the beginning of the
                    season, or only as needed?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>
                    Some farmers may not use pesticides on a regular basis, but only in special circumstances when there
                    is an infestation or maybe at the beginning of the growing season. Inquire about this, as well as
                    the farmer’s approach to dealing with pests. Pest control is a part of farming no matter what – but
                    methods to deal with it differ.

            <div class="accordion__question">
                <p>Do you have any certifications?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>Ask your farmer if he or she has any certifications, such as certified organic or any animal welfare
                    certifications if the farm raises animals. These certifications will vary from country to country.

                    Now, normally I say that labels are for tin cans and certifications aren’t the whole story of a
                    farm. But it’s good to know if your farmer has pursued any relevant certifications.

                    It’s definitely possible that a farm practices organic and biodynamic growing techniques, but can’t
                    afford the expensive certification process. That’s why it’s equally important to ask about how they
                    grow their food.</p>

            <div class="accordion__question">
                <p>How much water do my crops need and what is the best way to irrigate them?
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>The amount of water that crops need can vary greatly depending on the crop type, growth stage, and
                    local climate conditions. Generally, crops need more water during periods of rapid growth and
                    fruiting. The best way to irrigate crops will depend on the available water sources and the specific
                    irrigation system that the farmer has in place. Options for irrigation include overhead sprinklers,
                    drip irrigation, and furrow irrigation.

            <div class="accordion__question">
                <p>What is the optimal pH range for my soil and how can I maintain it?
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>The optimal pH range for soil varies depending on the crop, but most crops grow best in soil that has
                    a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. To maintain the soil pH, farmers can add lime to increase the pH or sulfur
                    to decrease the pH. Regular soil testing can help farmers determine the current pH level and make
                    adjustments as necessary.

                <p>How can I determine the nutrient needs of my soil and provide proper fertilization?

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>Soil testing is the best way to determine the nutrient needs of soil. Based on the test results,
                    farmers can apply the appropriate amounts of fertilizer to ensure that their crops have the
                    necessary nutrients for optimal growth. Fertilizers can be in the form of commercial fertilizers or
                    organic materials such as compost and manure.
